<p class=MsoNormal>This report presents the outcomes of a data science project
conducted using a structured and methodical analytical pipeline. While the code
used to generate these outcomes is not included in this document, the insights
were derived through a careful and rigorous analysis of data collected from a
variety of sources and merged for purposes of exploratory analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The analytical pipeline began with data collection,
gathering raw data from diverse sources. The next step, data ingestion,
involved loading the data into a suitable storage system for processing.
Afterward, extensive data wrangling and preprocessing were applied to ensure
the data's quality and consistency, which included handling missing values,
correcting inconsistencies, and transforming data formats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the data was cleaned, data transformation took place,
reshaping the data into the necessary structure for analysis. This was followed
by an exploratory data analysis (EDA), where initial patterns, trends, and
relationships were identified through visualization and descriptive statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Subsequent steps involved feature engineering, where new
features were created to enhance the analysis. The modeling and analysis stage
applied statistical methods and simple analytical techniques to the refined
dataset, resulting in actionable insights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This report serves as a static summary of the entire
process, with findings intended to support informed decision-making. No
predictive models were deployed, nor was there ongoing monitoring, as the focus
of this project was on foundational analysis rather than model-based automation
or production use. The insights and observations presented here are meant to
serve as a foundation for further inquiry or strategic direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This project was inspired by personal interest. I was
curious how Hennikers property taxes compare to other NH communities. My
interest continued to grow as voting season revved up, my December property tax
bill arrived, and talks of continued inflation painted the media. Rather than
accepting baseless claims at face value, I wanted to take the time to research
and verify Hennikers property tax information for myself. I aimed to provide
context by combining data from several different sources. Some of my findings
were as expected, and others came by surprise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This analysis focuses on exploring four main questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>About the
Data</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This analysis is based on data gathered from several town,
state, and federal sources. I believe these sources to be reasonably accurate
but its important to remember that data can be subject to interpretation, and
there may be nuances or variations depending on how and when the information
was collected and recorded from each source. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Information on tax rates and valuations from 1993-2024 was
sourced from the New Hampshire Department of Revenue. Information used to
compare populations of towns was taken from the New Hampshire Office of
Planning and Development (NH OPD). Historical Henniker population data was
collected from Henniker Annual Reports using the Economic and Community Profile
from 2008-2023. The US Census was used for the years 2000 and 1990, and a
regression analysis imputation was calculated and applied to remaining years where
sourced population data was not available. Data collected on price inflation
and wage inflation was taken from the US Department of Labor Statistics.
Overall, the data collected spans 32 years from 1993-2024. Population analysis is
primarily focused on a smaller range of roughly 16 years, from 2008-2024. This
was due to the inability to source earlier data relating to age segmentation in
Hennikers population.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Primary variables include the year, total tax rate, each
component of the total tax rate, valuation without utilities, estimated
population, median NH income, and Northeast CPI. Using these variables, I
engineered additional variables creating several percentage changes over time,
or lag variables, as well as a normalized index for price inflation, wage
inflation, and tax burden variables. Here is a more detailed description of each
data source:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tax Rate and Valuation Data</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Information on all NH town and city tax rates and valuations
from 1993-2024 was sourced from the New Hampshire Department of Revenue. This
data includes annualized historical property tax data for each NH town and
city. The primary variables used in the analysis include the date, town,
county, total tax rate, each component of the tax rate, and valuation without
utilities. Several of these variables were used for feature engineering. This
includes the date variable being used to create the <i>tax_yr</i> variable. Additionally,
lag variables in which the percentage change on an annual basis for several
variables were computed and incorporated into the analysis. The proportions of
tax components relative to the total tax rate were also engineered and applied
to the analysis. The <i>tax_burden</i> variable was engineered by dividing
validations without utilities by one-thousand and then multiplying the result by
the total tax rate in that year. The <i>tax_burden </i>approximates how much tax
revenues were collected based on valuation without utilities and tax rate. Its
important to note that this figure is a reasonable estimate and that uncollected
taxes, exceptions, and credits other than non-utility exceptions are likely to result
in nominal differences in actual property tax revenues. All information obtained
from the source regarding unincorporated NH towns has been removed from this
dataset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Historical Population Data  all NH towns</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Information used to compare populations of NH towns and
cities was taken from the New Hampshire Office of Planning and Development (NH
OPD). The variables obtained and used in the analysis include the town and its
corresponding estimated 2023 population. This population data was used only to
determine what New Hampshire towns and cities make good population benchmarks for
Henniker. It also assumes that no drastic population changes in towns used occurred
from 2023 to 2024. This data was not used in evaluating Hennikers population
overtime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Henniker Population Data</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Data used in evaluating Hennikers population overtime was
taken from Henniker Annual Town Reports in the Economic and Community Profile
section from 2008-2023. US Census population data was incorporated into this
historical data for the year 2000 and 1990. A regression analysis imputation
was then calculated and applied to remaining years where sourced data on Hennikers
population was not available. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Consumer Price Data</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Data collected on price inflation was gathered from the US Bureau
of Labor Statistics (BLS). Historical records of the Northeast Consumer Price
Index All-Items Report were utilized to gather the consumer price inflation information
used in the analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Wage Inflation Data</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wage Inflation was also collected from the US Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Historical Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics Reports
were utilized. The primary variable extracted from these reports was the median

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Additional Engineered Data</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As noted in some of the examples above, feature engineering
was vital to bringing context into the analysis. In addition to the examples of
feature engineering already mentioned, merging sources created new opportunities.
For example, the per capita tax burden was engineered using estimated population
and tax burden data. Tax burden, cpi, and wage data indexed variables were
created by normalizing each variable to the same scale. This allowed the trends
in cpi, wages, and tax burdens to be compared directly to one another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>NH Property
Tax Background</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In New Hampshire, property taxes are a primary source of
revenue for local governments and services. These taxes are levied on real
property (like land and buildings) and are calculated based on assessed values of
properties. Property tax rates in New Hampshire are expressed as a dollar
amount per $1,000 of assessed value. For example, if a property has an assessed
value of $100,000 and the property tax rate in the town is $25.00, the total
annual property taxes due will be $2,500. This method is informally known as
the &quot;three-finger rule.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, the combined assessed values of all taxable
real properties within a town or city are summed to form the communitys total
valuation, which serves as the basis for overall tax calculations. Because utilities
are often taxed under different rules or at different rates, many
municipalities exclude these properties from the primary valuation used to set
local tax rates. This approach ensures that the tax rate accurately reflects
the value of properties directly contributing to municipal services and
revenue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are four segmented components that make up the total
property tax rate. They are the municipal tax, county tax, local education tax,
and state education tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Municipal Tax (Town Services Tax):</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the tax rate is levied by the town to fund services
like fire, police, town highway departments, parks, and other town services.
The municipal tax rate directly funds the services that the town provides to
residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>County Tax:</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Counties in New Hampshire also impose property taxes. These
taxes fund county-wide services like the county court system, county jail, and
other further reaching public services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Local Education Tax (School District Tax):</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Towns and cities levy local education taxes to adequately
fund public schools, teacher salaries, maintenance of facilities, educational
programs, and other educational initiatives within their school district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>State Education Tax:</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The state education tax rate is a mandatory statewide
property tax that helps fund the public school system. All municipalities are
required to levy the state education tax rate on their property tax bills. This
tax is used to provide equalized funding for schools across New Hampshire,
ensuring that all districts have a baseline level of funding regardless of
local property values.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Henniker Baseline</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Henniker's tax rate was <b>$23.90</b> per $1,000 in accessed
value in 2024. Total 2024 town valuations without utilities equaled $<b>734,404,799</b>.
Both figures are critical in determining the property tax burden for individual
owners and the overall revenue generated by the town. As with all NH towns and

generated by the town.</p>

In comparison to all incorporated towns in NH, the total 2024 Henniker tax rate
is slightly above the third quantile. This means that in 2024, Henniker had a
higher total tax rate than most other incorporated towns in NH. Henniker's
property valuations (without utilities) are lower than the average but higher
than the median total valuations for all incorporated towns in NH. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given New Hampshire's unique tax structure which is heavily
reliant on property tax valuation, comparing Henniker to all towns and cities
in New Hampshire isn't appropriate or particularly useful. This is obvious when
we consider an over 16-million-dollar range in valuations and a $30.97 range in
total property tax rate throughout all incorporated NH towns and cities. Just
like any sensible person wouldn't use Vail as a benchmark for Pat's Peak,
comparing Henniker to Manchester or Rye doesn't provide us with useful or
actionable information. We need to find better comparisons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By filtering data to include only towns and cities located
in Merrimack County, we see improvement in Hennikers tax rate position. This
improvement could be attributed to more closely aligned geographic and economic
similarities. In Merrimack County, Henniker remains below average and above the
median in total valuations. Hennikers tax rate moves to a more favorable
level, falling within the middle 50% of all Merrimack County NH towns and
cities. However, Henniker is above both the mean and median property tax rate for
all incorporated towns and cities in Merrimack County.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think we can do better. Looking at only Merrimack County is
a comparative improvement, but it draws hard lines at close-by towns which may
be some of the most comparable in terms of geography and economic
accessibility. We're also failing to consider the size of the tax base which has
a known relationship with total valuation.  Ask yourself if it makes sense to
compare Henniker to Concord? They are both in Merrimack County, but Concord has
a more diverse revenue stream driven by increased business activity, a larger
population, and a broader tax base. These factors can significantly enhance its
financial capacity and support a wider range of public services. Henniker is also
uniquely situated in close proximity to three other counties. A better approach
may be to consider all towns in Merrimack County and the three other
surrounding counties. We can also set population parameters using data on town
and city populations. This should facilitate better comparisons.</p>

average tax rate falls very close to the center of this range at $23.78 per $1,000

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to emphasize again the importance of considering a
towns total valuation when making tax rate comparisons.  In New Hampshire,
towns with high property values dont need high tax rates to bring in the same
amount of money as towns with lower property values. That's why two neighboring
towns, especially when one has a lot of waterfront property, can have very
different tax rates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Boxplot of Valuation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The boxplot below shows where Henniker valuations stack up
in our benchmark sample. We see that there is a very noticeable outlier where
property valuation is substantially higher than the other 14 towns in the
benchmark sample. The outlier represents New London, NH. New London borders the
renown Lake Sunapee and is also home to Little Lake Sunapee, Pleasant Lake, and
a few other lesser-known lakes. Waterfront property in New London is abundant
and the towns high total valuation reflects that. Although New London shares many
similarities with the towns in our sample, its multi-million-dollar lakefront
properties make it incomparable in terms of valuation and property tax rate.
You may remember that New London also had the lowest tax rate in our sample.
Given that they have the highest total property valuations, they can generate
the same or more property tax revenue using a lower tax rate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a perfect example of the imbalances that exist in
New Hampshire's property reliant tax structure.  In 2024, if you lived 25
minutes north of Henniker in the town of New London and lived in home accessed at
$400,000, not only would you save almost $5,000 annually on property taxes, but
you would also have better funded schools, fire, police, roads, parks, and
other tax funded services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since Henniker doesn't attract the multi-million-dollar real
estate market that New London does, it makes sense to remove New London from
the sample concluding that it is not appropriate to compare to Henniker. Let's
see how the removal of New London affects our total tax rate and total
valuation.</p>

or just learned, about New Hampshire tax rates relationship with validations,
it makes sense that our tax rate is lower than the benchmark sample average
since our valuations are higher than the benchmark sample average. However,
it's important to recognize that the balance is disproportionate. Hennikers tax
rate is only slightly lower, but its valuations are substantially higher. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our previous exploration, New London had the highest
valuation and the lowest tax rate in the sample. Although that was the case, New
Londons lower tax rate was also disproportionate with their valuations. Simply
consider that their tax rate wasn't an outlier, but their valuations were. This
suggests that their tax rate is high relative to their total valuations. In
other words, New London is raising considerably more revenue per capita for
roughly the same tax funding needs, and theyre doing it at a lower tax rate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Comparatively, Henniker has the second highest valuation in
the revised benchmark sample but only the 6th lowest tax rate in the sample.
Henniker is also generating more revenue at a lower tax rate just not to the

<p class=MsoNormal>This plot tracks the percentage change in the tax rate and
the percentage change in property valuations over time. The diamond shapes that
form in the plot more often than not reflect property reassessments. During
property re-assessment years, total town valuations increase or decrease due to
the reassessment of property values. Tax rates often follow suite by decreasing
or increasing to combat these changes. This stabilizes town revenues and
property taxpayer burden during reassessment years. When reassessments occur
and property values increase, the same amount of money can be collected by the
town at a lower tax rate. When valuations decrease, higher tax rates are needed
for the town to collect the same amount of revenue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the exception of several re-assessment years,
valuations are largely stable. However, the property tax rate is more erratic.
This makes sense considering that our form of government allows for annual
changes in the property tax rate but not in valuation. In years where the
diamond shapes do not form, most notably in 1999 or 2008, tax rate changes
either increase or decrease the burden on property taxpayers. 1999 could be
viewed as a rate-driven tax break that lessened the burden on taxpayers. 2008
is an example of a rate-driven hike, placing more burden on taxpayers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, if we look closer at the diamond shaped years,
we can see that the percentage drop in either tax rate or valuation is not
equal to the counter action increase in tax rate or valuation. For example, In
2005 valuations increased by over 100% while tax rates dropped by less than
50%. This results in a value-driven increase, putting more tax burden on
property taxpayers through increased valuations. Overall, an increase in tax
burden has been more common than a decrease in tax burden in Henniker from 1993
to 2024.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By dividing validation records (without utilities) by one
thousand and then multiplying the result by each years effective tax rate, we
can determine how much revenue the town positioned itself to generate from
property taxes each year, or the tax burden on property taxpayers. It's
necessary to understand that this calculation is a simplified representation
and does not consider special exceptions such as Henniker's elderly, disabled,
or veteran related property tax discounts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This plot gives us a visual representation of Henniker
property tax revenues collected over time. It's clear that property tax
generated revenues have increased from 1993 to 2024. In 1993, the town
generated about 5 million in property tax revenues. In 2024, that same revenue
stream generates roughly 17.5 million in revenues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At first glance this may seem concerning, but we have to
consider the underlying factors that lead to these increases or decreases in
revenue over time. Some of the most relevant factors related to these increases
or decreases include changes in town population and changes in inflation. Next,
we'll consider how these two underlying factors compare to the increase in Hennikers
property tax revenue generation since 1993.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>CIP vs Per Capita Tax Burden over time</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By calculating the year-over-year changes in Henniker's
property valuations and tax rates, we can compare shifts in the property tax
burden relative to population growth and inflation. This approach helps
illustrate how tax burden has evolved over time in the context of the broader
economic picture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To account for population changes, I calculated the per
capita property tax burden for each year. Additionally, I normalized both the
consumer price index (CPI) and the per capita tax burden to a base value of
100, starting from 1993. This normalization ensures that per capita tax burden
and inflation are directly comparable on the same scale.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can see that from 1993 to 1998, the per capita tax burden
increased faster than inflation. In 1999, the per capita tax burden sharply
decreased before equalizing again in 2000. The per capita property tax burden
then increased faster than inflation for the next 18 years, with the largest
difference in per capita tax burden and inflation being felt in 2011, 2017 and
in 2019. In 2020, the per capita tax burden receded. Most recently in 2023 and in
2024, the per capita tax burden is rising again faster than inflation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the per capita tax burden rises faster than inflation,
it places more pressure on property owners by forcing them to pay a larger
portion of their income toward taxes. For example, a Henniker resident in 1994 paid
about as much of their income toward property taxes as a resident in 2022. In 2011,
2017 and in 2019, residents paid a much larger share of their income toward
property taxes. Overall, the per capita tax burden in Henniker has outpaced
inflation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although this plot provides some great insights through
added context, in order to truly understand taxpayer burden, we must consider
wage inflation. Thus far, we've assumed that taxpayer wages (private or public)
have increased at the same pace as consumer price inflation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>CPI, tax burden, and wage inflation over time</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this plot, I've normalized New Hampshire annual median
wage inflation data from 1993 to 2024. Given limitations on the availability of
wage data from 1993-1996 and in 2024, I used a regression imputation to
estimate wage data for these first 5 years. This plot allows us to visualize
how the Henniker property tax burden compares to trends in Northeast CPI
inflation and in New Hampshire wage inflation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To my surprise, wage growth in New Hampshire has outpaced
inflation, generally increasing NH residents spending power since 1993. The
plot shows this through the widening gap between the Northeast CPI line plot
(red) and the NH Median Wage line plot (green). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, the property tax burden in Henniker has often eaten
up much or all of that increased spending power. This is visualized by the Per
Capita Valuation + Tax Effect line plot (blue) in relation to NH Median Wage
line plot (green). We can see that in some years, like in 2000, spending power
increased. In other years, like 2010, it decreased after factoring in property
tax burden. More recently, since 2020, spending power has been improving, as
wage growth has outpaced the tax burden and the Northeast CPI has remained
lower than the tax burden. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This current balance of property tax burden falling in-between
wage inflation and CPI inflation could be considered ideal. It allows for
investment in town services at a level above inflation (actual growth), while simultaneously
ensuring property taxpayers have more disposable income.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These findings seem to contradict some recent narratives, so
I believe its important to clarify a few points before moving on. First, by
using the median wage, weve filtered out extreme outliers like CEO pay,
which can skew data. Second, wages are not a measure of wealth or net worth.
Many wealthy business owners and retirees, in an effort to minimize federal
income taxes, often pay themselves the smallest salary they can live on. Since
their homes, cars, and other assets may already be paid for, they can maintain
a high standard of living while paying little or no federal income tax. These
'non-storytelling' salaries are included in our wage data. Third, because were
considering all industries, its important to note that some sectors may have
experienced significant declines, while others have seen substantial gains. Net
wage growth doesn't account for industry-specific changes. In sectors like manufacturing
and retail, wages may have lagged behind inflation, while in industries like
technology and healthcare, wages may have grown much faster than inflation.
Overall median wage growth doesn't capture these disparities across different sectors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, not all CPI segments have grown or declined
equally. While costs for insurance and healthcare have skyrocketed, prices for
consumer goods may have stagnated or even declined in some years. This
variation within the CPI index itself means that general inflation measures
don't necessarily reflect the cost of living for all households equally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead of diving deeper into specifics related to NH wages
and Northeast CPI inflation, let's take a closer look at how Henniker property
tax dollars are historically being allocated within our town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This plot helps us to understand how each component of our

most noticeable visualizations is the absence of the State Education tax from
1993-1999. Prior to 1999, New Hampshire did not have a state education tax
component and relied solely on the local education tax component to fund public
schools. Interestingly, a higher percentage of tax dollars were still being
spent on schooling before the state school tax component was introduced.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The green coloring shows a steady decline in state education
taxes as a percentage of the total tax. In fact, from its inception, the
portion of total taxes being spent on state education has declined. As of 2024,
state education tax has the lowest burden on Henniker property taxes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That being said, this plot makes it clear that the local
education tax component of property taxes in Henniker is the largest portion of
property tax bills. However, upon close inspection, youll notice that from
1996 to 2022, the percentage of the total property tax being allocated to
schools has shrunk from about 75% in 1995 to about 54% in 2022. For almost
three decades education funding in Henniker as a percentage of the total
property tax bill has declined. In 2023 and 2024 portions of local education as
a percentage of the total are increasing again. It will be interesting to see
if these 2023 and 2024 increases start to reverse the trend or if 2023 and 2024
are simple fluctuations in the long-term downward trend in Hennikers investment
in public schools and in children.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The blue coloring represents the municipal tax component as
a portion of the total property tax bill in Henniker. It shows a long-term
upward trend. The municipal percentage of the total tax rate has been growing
over the past three decades. This trend suggests that overtime, a larger
percentage of town revenues are being allocated to town services such as fire,
police, highway department, parks, and other town services and projects.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The county tax rate as a portion of the total has mostly
been consistent. There have been some small fluctuations in the county tax rate
as a percentage of the total tax rate, but not noteworthy in comparison to the
other three property tax rate components.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk200631390"><b>School Taxes vs non-school taxes</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This plot gives us a better visual of how the portion of
taxes being spent on non-school services has been steadily increasing while the
portion of taxes being spent on public schools has steadily been decreasing.
For example, in 1995 about 76% of the taxes collected went to public schooling
and about 24% was spent on non-school related services. In comparison, in 2022,
about 54% of taxes collected were allocated to public schooling while 46% were
allocated to non-school services. It's worth noting that in the two most recent
years, 2023 and 2024 this long-term trend may be starting to reverse.</p>

4: A Closer Look at Hennikers Population</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some justification could be made for school and non-school historical
funding trends. For example, if our town has seen significant population growth
in older age groups and significant population declines in younger age groups.
Generally speaking, younger age groups and families benefit directly from the
public school system, while older age groups and childless households may be
less likely to benefit directly from the public school system. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Estimated population data is available for Henniker
throughout the 1993-2024 timeline. However, the population by age data is more
limited. Age specific data has only been captured since 2005. We can gain a
general impression about population age trends in Henniker, but we cannot
directly make comparisons dating from 1993 to 2005. Let's start by looking at
the general population growth in Henniker since 1993.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This plot shows the change in age groups from 2009 to 2024
in Henniker. We can see that the under 5 age group has been mostly steady with
small gains in population since 2009. The age group 55-65 years old saw a quick
increase from 2009-2010 but then steadied to small gains from 2010-2024. Age
groups 65 and older and 20-35 years old, considered the least likely to benefit
directly from public schools, saw small declines from 2009-2016 and then
substantial growth from 2015-2024. Age groups 5-19 and 35-54, considered the
most likely to directly benefit from public schools, both have declined since
2009 despite recently experiencing increases.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, the declines in age groups 5-19 and 35-45 may suggest
that Henniker has been losing families as a percentage of its total population.
Large increases in the 65 and older age group also suggest an aging population
trend in Henniker. This information lends itself to some generalizations we've
all heard about regarding NH state population trends. New Hampshire's tax
structure and economy lends itself to retirees and an older population. With a
large swath of the population in or nearing retirement age, New Hampshire has
grown in population and has also grown older in population. Henniker seems
aligned with this widespread NH generalization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Group based Generalization of Child Homes and Childless
Homes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Looking at age group trends and trying to compare them to
school spending leads to a lot of open discussion. Assumptions about age play
an intricate role in comparative interpretation and those assumptions are not
always accurate. For example, a common assumption may be that people over 55
don't benefit directly from the public school system. This assumption wouldn't
consider older parents or grandparents directly caring for children, or people
over 55 that work in the school system (Henniker's largest full-time employer).
Indirectly, well-funded school systems are known to increase property values, attract
higher income residents, benefit local business, and boost a sense of
community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In review of this plot, we can see that from 2009 - 2024 the
population of households likely to directly benefit from our public-school
systems has shrunk from about 64% of the total population about 41% since 2009.
The population that generally only benefits indirectly grew by that same 23%
margin, from about 36% in 2009 to 59% in 2024.  This could provide some
rational to the long-term trend of allocating a smaller portion of property tax
revenues to the public school system and spending a larger portion of funding on
non-school services. For example, one rational may be that an older population
has an increased need for ambulance services while fewer teachers may be needed
to serve declining younger populations relative to the overall population.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, this population by age comparison generates more
questions than answers about the portion of funding allocated for school and
non-school services over time. It doesn't provide concrete answers to questions
due to assumptions being made and the complexity of how public schools interact
with town culture and society. Nonetheless its interesting to consider the
role of age in tax component allocation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>Key
Findings &amp; Insights</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, it appears that the 2024 Henniker tax rate is well
positioned. Although the rate is high in comparison to NH as a whole, it is
much more competitive when comparing it to towns of similar size and location. The
Henniker property tax rate is very close to the average tax rate and below the
median tax rate in our benchmark sample. Valuations in Henniker are noticeably higher
in comparison to similar towns. I think this is a favorable position. Hennikers
high property validation, combined with a competitive tax rate, gives it
greater financial flexibility compared to similar towns. It can generate more
revenue at a lower rate, maintaining a competitive edge while still funding
services at or above benchmark levels. This also allows Henniker to reduce tax
rates if desired, with less impact on service levels while keeping them aligned
at or above comparable towns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over time Henniker tends to increase taxpayer burden at a faster
rate than consumer inflation. However, wage inflation has largely cushioned
that impact on taxpayers. Most recently, Henniker seems to have positioned its
tax burden in-between consumer inflation and wage inflation. This is ideal
since it allows for investment and growth in the community through increased tax
funded services without depleting all taxpayer gains from wage inflation. As taxpayers
disposable income increases, they are able to inject additional earnings into
the Henniker community, creating a win-win situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hennikers population appears to be aging and its impacting
the public school system negatively while impacting town services positively.
The percentage of revenue spent on the public school system as a portion of all
taxes collected has largely declined since 1993. In that same time, town
services have benefited from a larger portion of the property tax generated
revenues. Although this trend is showing recent signs of easing, the long-term
trend suggests that we should continue to expect weakening public schools and enhanced
fire, police, highway, and other town services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>Additional
Remarks</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall Henniker appears to have balanced the property tax
rate and valuation responsibly over time. There will always be a debate about
how much funding is needed and how those funds should be allocated. However,
the trends discovered in this analysis dont show signs of negligence or
incompetence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently Henniker is hovering the property taxpayer burden
above consumer inflation but below wage inflation.  If this trend continues I would
expect positive outcomes for the town. However, if the taxpayer burden consumes
all gains in taxpayer wage inflation as it has in the past, it may limit local private
sector growth opportunity. The town should aim to balance public and private investment
for the best outcomes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reality is that New Hampshire towns without geographical
draws like big lake or oceanfront access cannot compete on a tax basis with
those NH towns that do. However, Henniker could incorporate this </p>
